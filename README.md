# Firebase Data Sender

This is a simple web application that collects user data through a form and sends it to a Firebase Realtime Database. The user-provided data includes the name, age, and email address.

## Usage

1. Access the web application through a web browser.
2. Fill in the required fields in the form:
   - **Name**: Enter your name.
   - **Age**: Enter your age.
   - **Email**: Enter your email address.
3. Click the "Send Data to Firebase" button to submit the data.
4. You will receive feedback (in the console, press F12) indicating whether the data was sent successfully or if there was an error.
